# Trailing zeros in factorial

https://interviewbit.com/problems/trailing-zeros-in-factorial

Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

Example :

n = 5
n! = 120 
Number of trailing zeros = 1
So, return 1

## Hint 1

Trailing zeroes are obtained from powers of 10.

How can you find powers of 10 in a factorial?

## Solution Approach

The idea is:

The ZERO comes from 10.

The 10 comes from 2 x 5

And we need to account for all the products of 5 and 2, like 4x5 = 20 ...

So, if we take all the numbers with 5 as a factor, we will have plenty of even numbers to pair with them to get factors of 10

Example 1:

How many multiples of 5 are there between 1 and 23?

These are 5, 10, 15, and 20, for four multiples of 5. Paired with 2s from the even factors, this makes for four factors of 10, so: 23! has 4 zeros.

Example 2:

How many multiples of 5 are there in the numbers from 1 to 100?

Because 100 / 5 = 20, so, there are twenty multiples of 5 between 1 and 100.

But wait, actually 25 is 5 * 5, so each multiple of 25 has an extra factor of 5, e.g. 25 * 4 = 100 which introduces an extra of zero.

So, we need to know how many multiples of 25 are there between 1 and 100? Since 100 / 25 = 4, there are four multiples of 25 between 1 and 100.

Finally, we get 20 + 4 = 24 trailing zeroes in 100!

The above examples tell us that we need to care about 5, 5 * 5, 5 * 5 * 5, 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 ...

Example 3:

For given number 4617.

5^1: 4617 / 5 = 923.4, so we get 923 factors of 5

5^2: 4617 / 25 = 184.68, so we get 184 additional factors of 5

5^3: 4617 / 125 = 36.936, so we get 36 additional factors of 5

5^4: 4617 / 625 = 7.3872, so we get 7 additional factors of 5

5^5: 4617 / 3125 = 1.47744, so we get 1 more factor of 5

5^6: 4617 / 15625 = 0.295488, which is less than 1, so stop here.

Therefore, 4617! has 923 + 184 + 36 + 7 + 1 = 1151 trailing zeroes.


## Solution

```cpp
int Solution::trailingZeroes(int n) {
    //A trailing zero is always produced by prime factor 5.
    //If we can count the number of 5s, our task is done.
    //first divide n by 5 and remove all single 5s,
    //then divide by 25 to remove extra 5s and so on
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 5; n / i >= 1; i *= 5) 
        count += n / i;
    return count;
}
```
