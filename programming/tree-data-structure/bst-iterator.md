# Bst Iterator

https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/bst-iterator/

Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

The first call to next() will return the smallest number in BST. Calling next() again will return the next smallest number in the BST, and so on.

 Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.
Try to optimize the additional space complexity apart from the amortized time complexity. 

## Hint 1

Take a look at particular node and its child. If sorted their order will be LEFT,ROOT,RIGHT.

This is somewhat similar to inorder traversal. You can proceed in this direction and try
to come up with different solutions using different amount of extra spaces.

## Solution Approach

Approach 1: Do an inorder traversal of the tree and store the entries in an array with the
current pointer set to the start of the array. hasNext checks if the pointer is less than the size
of the array. next() would return the element at the current position incrementing the position by 1. 
However, this has an additional space complexity of O(N) where N = number of nodes in the tree. 
This might be an acceptable answer. Most interviewers would look for you to do better.

Approach 2: Lets look at the version of this problem when the trees have a back pointer.
Can you solve the problem without using additional space ? When you are on node N and are asked
for next element, you obviously won't go to the left subtree as all the elements there are smaller
than N. We would go to the smallest number in the right subtree if the right subtree is not null.
If the right subtree is null, that means that we need to move up, and keep moving up till we are
coming from the right subtree. 
Now we don't have the back pointer in this case. So, we need something to keep track of the path
from root to the current node, so we can move to the parent when needed. Do note that storing the
path from root to the current node only requires memory equivalent to the length of the path which
is the depth of the tree. Also, we can track the path using stack.

## Solution

### Editorial

```cpp
class BSTIterator {
public:
    stack<TreeNode *> myStack;

    BSTIterator(TreeNode *root) {
        pushAll(root);
    }

    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    bool hasNext() {
        return !myStack.empty();
    }

    /** @return the next smallest number */
    int next() {
        TreeNode *tmpNode = myStack.top();
        myStack.pop();
        pushAll(tmpNode->right);
        return tmpNode->val;
    }

private:
    void pushAll(TreeNode *node) {
        while (node != NULL) {
            myStack.push(node);
            node = node->left;
        }
    }
};
```
### Fastest

```cpp
vector<int> trav;
int cur;

void func(TreeNode *ptr) {
    if (!ptr)
        return;
    func(ptr->left);
    trav.push_back(ptr->val);
    func(ptr->right);
}

BSTIterator::BSTIterator(TreeNode *root) {
    trav.clear();
    cur = 0;
    func(root);
}

bool BSTIterator::hasNext() {
    return cur < trav.size();
}

int BSTIterator::next() {
    if (cur < trav.size()) {
        int tmp = trav[cur];
        cur++;
        return tmp;
    }
}
```

### Mine
```cpp

stack<TreeNode *> path;
void pushall(TreeNode *root) {
    while (root) {
        path.push(root);
        root = root->left;
    }
}

BSTIterator::BSTIterator(TreeNode *root) {
    pushall(root);
}

/** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
bool BSTIterator::hasNext() {
    return !path.empty();
}

/** @return the next smallest number */
int BSTIterator::next() {
    TreeNode *tmp = path.top();
    path.pop();
    pushall(tmp->right);
    return tmp->val;
}

/**
 * Your BSTIterator will be called like this:
 * BSTIterator i = BSTIterator(root);
 * while (i.hasNext()) cout << i.next();
 */
```
