# Largest Distance between nodes of a Tree

## Find largest distance

Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists of N (2 <= N <= 40000) nodes.
The goal of the problem is to find largest distance between two nodes in a tree.
Distance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the nodes
(there will be a unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree).
The nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.

The tree is given as an array P, there is an edge between nodes P[i] and i (0 <= i < N).
Exactly one of the i's will have P[i] equal to -1, it will be root node.

Example:

```
If given P is [-1, 0, 0, 0, 3], then node 0 is the root and the whole tree looks like this:

          0
       /  |  \
      1   2   3
               \
                4  
```
One of the longest path is 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 and its length is 3, thus the answer is 3.
Note that there are other paths with maximal distance

## Hint 1

How would you solve the problem if you knew the longest path certainly goes through root? Try to generalize this approach for other nodes.

## Solution Approach
```
1) pick any node u
2) find the node which is farthest from u, call it x (calculate using the same approach as in Solution 1)
3) find the node which is farthest from x, call it q (calculate using the same approach as in Solution 1)
The answer will be the length of a path from x to q.

Proof of correctness:

The crucial step is to prove that x will be one of the endpoints of
the path with maximal length (note that there might be more than one such path).
If it is, then the longest path from x will be the longest path in the tree.

Let d(v1, v2) be length of path between v1 and v2

Let's prove it by contradiction: assume there is a strictly longer path between s and t,
neither of which is x. Let h be a node which is closest to u among the nodes on a path between s and t.
Then there are two cases:

1) h is on path between u and x

    u
    |
    |
    |
    h   x
   / \ /
  /   *
 /     \
s       t 
then d(s, t) = d(s, h) + d(h, t) <= d(s, h) + d(h, x) = d(s, x), which contradicts assumption.

2) h is not on path between u and x

    u
    |
    *---x
    |
    h
   / \
  /   \
 /     \
s       t

then

d(u, s) <= d(u, x) <= d(u, h) + d(h, x)
d(u, t) <= d(u, x) <= d(u, h) + d(h, x)

d(s, t) = d(s, h) + d(h, t)
= d(u, s) + d(u, t) - 2 d(u, h)
<= 2 d(h, x)

2 d(s, t) <= d(s, t) + 2 d(h, x)
= d(s, h) + d(h, x) + d(x, h) + d(h, t)
= d(x, s) + d(x, t)

This means that max(d(v, s), d(v, t)) >= d(s, t), which also contradicts assumption.

Thus, we proved that farthest node of a node will be one of the endpoints of the longest path.

```cpp
int max_ans;
int dfs(int src,vector<int>tree[]) {
    int max1=0,max2=0;
    int size=tree[src].size();//no of childs of src
    if(size==0)//this node will contribute 1 edge when linked with its parent
        return 1;
    for(int i=0;i<size;i++) {
        int ans=dfs(tree[src][i],tree);
        if(ans>max1) {
            max2=max1;
            max1=ans;
        } else if(ans>max2)
            max2=ans;
    }
    max_ans=max(max_ans,max1+max2);
    return 1+max(max1,max2);
}

int Solution::solve(vector<int> &A) {
    max_ans=0;
    int n=A.size();
    if(n<2)
        return 0;

    //nodes will be 0 to n-1
    int root=-1;
    vector<int>tree[n];

    for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
        if(A[i]==-1) {
            root=i;
            continue;
        }
        int src=A[i],dest=i;
        tree[src].push_back(dest);
    }
    //now start dfs with root
    dfs(root,tree);
    return max_ans;
}
