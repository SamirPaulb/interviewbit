# Diffk
https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/diffk/

Given an array 'A' of sorted integers and another non negative integer k, find if there exists 2 indices i and j such that A[i] - A[j] = k, i != j.

 Example: Input : 
    A : [1 3 5] 
    k : 4
 Output : YES as 5 - 1 = 4 
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem

Try doing this in less than linear space complexity.

## Hint 1

The naive approach obviously is exloring all combinations of 2 integers using 2 loops and then checking their difference.

But can we use the fact that the array is sorted?

What if we have 2 pointers both pointing towards the start of the array?

## Solution Approach

Let us first look at why 2 pointer approach works here. 
A naive 2 loop approach would be:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
  for (int j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
    if (A[j] - A[i] > diff) break; // No need going forward as the difference is going to increase even further. 
    if (A[j] - A[i] == diff) return true; 
  }
}
```
Now, let us say that for i = I, we we exploring j.

At j = J - 1, our difference D1 was less than diff
At j = J, our difference D2 exceeded diff.
When i = I + 1, our A[i] increases ( as the array is sorted ). 
So, for j = J - 1, the differece will be smaller than D1 
(which is even more smaller to diff.) 
Which means we do not need to explore j <= J - 1 
and we can begin exploring directly from j = J. 
So, j only keeps moving in forward direction and never needs to come back as i increases.

Let us use that in a solution now:

```cpp
int j = 0; 
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
  j = max(j, i+1);
  while (j < len && (arr[j] - arr[i] < diff)) j += 1;
  if (arr[j] - arr[i] == diff) return true;
}
```

## Solution

### Editorial

```cpp
int Solution::diffPossible(vector<int> &num, int diff) {
    if (num.size() < 2 || diff < 0) return false;
    int j = 0, len = num.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
        j = max(j, i + 1);
        while (j < len && num[j] - num[i] < diff) j += 1;
        if (j < len && num[j] - num[i] == diff) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Mine

```cpp
int Solution::diffPossible(vector<int> &A, int B) {
    int l = 0, r = 1;
    while(r < A.size()) {
        int diff = A[r] - A[l];
        if (diff == B)
            return 1;
        if (diff > B)
            l++;
        else
            r++;
        if (l == r)
            r++;
        }
    return 0;
}
```
