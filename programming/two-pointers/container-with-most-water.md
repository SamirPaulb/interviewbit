# Container With Most Water

https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/container-with-most-water


Given n non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an,` where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`,
`n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`.

Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Your program should return an integer which corresponds to the maximum area of water that can be contained.

(Yes, we know maximum area instead of maximum volume sounds weird. But this is 2D plane we are working with for simplicity.)

### Note

You may not slant the container.

### Example

```
Input : [1, 5, 4, 3]
Output : 6

Explanation : 5 and 3 are distance 2 apart. So size of the base = 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. 
So total area = 3 * 2 = 6
```

## Hint 1

Area will be basically min(ai,aj)*(j-i) where j>i.

Approach 1 (in direction of O(n)) :
Will the area be maximum if you take j-i to be maximum. If not, then can you reduce the problem to simpler set?

Approach 2 (in direction of O(nlogn)) :
Sort the elements with their indexes in descending order.
Start iterating from first position of sorted array while maintaing the maximum of answer. How?

## Hint 2

Description of approach 1:

Note 1: When you consider a1 and aN, then the area is (N-1) * min(a1, aN).
Note 2: The base (N-1) is the maximum possible.
This implies that if there was a better solution possible, it will definitely have height greater than min(a1, aN).

B * H > (N-1) * min(a1, aN)
We know that, B < (N-1)
So, H > min(a1, aN)

This means that we can discard min(a1, aN) from our set and look to solve this problem again from the start. 
If a1 < aN, then the problem reduces to solving the same thing for a2, aN. 
Else, it reduces to solving the same thing for a1, aN-1

## Solution

```cpp

// my

int Solution::maxArea(vector<int> &A) {
    int area = 0;
    int p = 0, q = A.size() - 1;
    while (p < q) {
        area = max(area, min(A[p], A[q]) * (q - p));
        if (A[p] < A[q])
            ++p;
        else
            --q;
    }
    return area;
}

int Solution::maxArea(vector<int> &height) {
    int end = height.size() - 1, start = 0;
    int maxVol = 0;

    while (start < end) {
        maxVol = max(maxVol, (end - start) * min(height[start], height[end]));

        if (height[start] < height[end]) {
            start++;
        } else {
            end--;
        }
    }
    return maxVol;
}

// fastest

int Solution::maxArea(vector<int> &A) {
    int n = A.size();
    int area = (n - 1) * min(A[0], A[n - 1]);
    int i = 0, j = n - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        area = max(area, (j - i) * min(A[i], A[j]));
        if (A[i] < A[j])
            i++;
        else
            j--;
    }
    return area;
}

/////////// twitter version (there could be only 1 or two puddles)

int Solution::maxArea(vector<int> &land) {
    int leftMax = 0;
    int rightMax = 0;
    int left = 0;
    int right = land.size() - 1;
    int volume = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        if (land[left] > leftMax) {
            leftMax = land[left];
        }
        if (land[right] > rightMax) {
            rightMax = land[right];
        }
        if (leftMax >= rightMax) {
            volume += rightMax - land[right];
            right--;
        } else {
            volume += leftMax - land[left];
            left++;
        }
    }
    return volume;
}
