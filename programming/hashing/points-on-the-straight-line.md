# Points On The Straight Line

https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/points-on-the-straight-line



A line is made by a pair of points. 
If a,b and c lie on the same line, then line connecting a and b, and line connecting a and c will have the same slope ( (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)).

Make sure you handle all the corner cases.

1) Have you handled overlapping points ? 
2) Have you handled negative points for the same slope ? Like (0,0), (1,1) and (-1, -1)
3) Did you make sure that there are no divisions by 0 ? Like (1, 0), (1,4), (1, -1) 
4) How do you handle when one of the differences in x and y is 0, and the other difference is negative / positive ? Like (4, -4), (8, -4), (-4, -4)
